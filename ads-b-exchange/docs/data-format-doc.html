                All filters (except the Bounds filters) are passed with a name that consists of a prefix and then a single-character code that describes the condition.
                If the condition is negated / reversed (e.g. NOT equal to) then a suffix of N is also appended. The full list of conditions is as-per below:
            </p>

            <div class="table-responsive">
                <table class="table table-condensed table-striped">

            </div>

            <p>
                When a range has both an upper and a lower bound then two query string parameters need to be passed, one for the upper and one
                for the lower. If one part of the range is negated (i.e. it has an N suffix) then the other part must also be negated.
            </p>
            <p>
                The order in which filter parameters are passed has no effect, an aircraft must match all of the filters in order for it to
                pass. In effect the filters are ANDed together. If the aircraft does not have a value for a particular filter type (e.g. you
                filter against a callsign and the aircraft has no callsign) then it will only match against filters that have no value (e.g.
                <b>fCallQ=</b>) or filters that are negated (e.g. <b>fCallQN=BAW1</b>).
            </p>
            <p>
                The Enum filter values are the enum to match (or not match) against. The enums are strings described in the JavaScript file
                <code>enums.js</code>. Boolean filters should pass 0 for false, 1 for true or nothing for undefined.
            </p>
            <p>
                The four parameters that make up the Bounds filter do not accept a condition. If you supply one of the bounds then you must supply
                all of them and the effect will be to only return aircraft that have a position within those bounds. If you supply the selected
                aircraft ID in <em>selAc</em> then the selected aircraft will always returned in an aircraft list that has been constrained to a
                Bounds, even if the selected aircraft isn't within the bounds that you supply.
            </p>

            <p>
                All of the filters are case insensitive.
            </p>

            <p>
                So for example, if you wanted to constrain the list to only aircraft whose model ICAO type code starts with &quot;A38&quot; then
                you would pass a filter parameter of <b>fTypeS=A38</b>. If you want to filter just to those aircraft whose model ICAO type code
                does <em>not</em> start with &quot;A38&quot; then you would pass <b>fTypSN=A38</b>. If you wanted to filter to just those aircraft
                that do not have a model ICAO type code then you would pass <b>fTypQ=</b>, and similarly if you only wanted aircraft that have
                something, anything, for a model ICAO type code then it'd be <b>fTypQN=</b>.
            </p>

            <h2 id="known-aircraft" data-site-jump-submenu="">
                Known Aircraft
            </h2>
            <p>
                When a browser first opens the map page it sends a request for an <var>AircraftList.json</var> that contains everything that the
                site knows about every aircraft being tracked.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the second and subsequent requests the site tells the server which aircraft identifiers it now knows about. The server uses
                this information along with the <var>ldv</var> query string value to avoid resending information that has not changed. It uses
                these values to reduce the bandwidth for the second and subsequent requests.
            </p>
            <p>
                The &quot;known aircraft&quot; list is a list of aircraft identifiers. There are two ways that you can send the list to the server:
                the old way and the new way.
            </p>

            <h3>
                The old way
            </h3>
            <p>
                The old way was to create a comma-separated list of aircraft identifiers (their numerical <var>UniqueID</var> identifiers, not
                the six character ICAO identifier) and send that in a header called <b>X-VirtualRadarServer-AircraftIds</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are sending a GET request then this is the only way that you can tell the server about known aircraft.
            </p>

            <h3>
                The new way
            </h3>
            <p>
                The new way is to send a POST request rather than a GET and to send the known aircraft identifiers as a standard URL encoded
                form field in the body. The field is called <var>icaos</var>. The field value should be a hyphen separated list of six
                character ICAO hex codes for every known aircraft.
            </p>
            <p>
                Virtual Radar Server has been using the new mechanism since version 2.2 but it continues to support both methods.

            <p>
                The response is a JSON file. The first response will always contain everything that it knows about every aircraft that passes the filters
                (if any were supplied). Subsequent fetches will only return information that has changed, unless you fail to pass the correct <em>ldv</em>
                query parameter and <em>Known Aircraft</em> list.

            <h3 id="note1" data-site-jump-submenu="">Note 1 - Short Trails (Cos)</h3>
            <p>Short trails are a list of values that represent the positions that the aircraft has been seen in over so-many seconds (by default 30 seconds).</p>
            <p>
                The array is an array of numbers. The numbers are arranged in groups of either 3 or 4, depending on whether just positions are being sent or
                whether the altitude or speed is also being sent.
            </p>
            <p>
                If just positions are being sent (<em>TT</em> is empty or missing) then the first value is latitude, the second value is longitude and the third
                is the server time that the position was seen at UTC in JavaScript ticks.
            </p>
            <p>
                If altitude or speeds are also being sent (<em>TT</em> is either 'a' for altitude or 's' for speed) then the first value is latitude, the second
                longitude, the third is server time and the fourth is either altitude or speed.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first group of values represents the earliest position in the trail while the last group represents the latest position in the trail. If
                <em>ResetTrail</em> is true then the array contains the entire trail over the last 30 seconds, otherwise it just holds the coordinates added to
                the trail since you last fetched the aircraft list.
            </p>
            <p>
                To look at it another way, if Cos is an array of n numbers and <em>TT</em> is an empty string then the values represent:

            <h3 id="note2" data-site-jump-submenu="">Note 2 - Full Trails (Cot)</h3>
            <p>Full trails are a list of values that represent the positions that the aircraft has been seen in since it was first picked up.</p>
            <p>
                The array is an array of numbers. It's very similar to short trails (see <a href="#note1">Note 1 - Cos</a> above) except that instead
                of being sent the server time you are sent the heading of the aircraft at each coordinate. The idea is that the full track only shows
                the position the aircraft was in when its heading changed, so that if an aircraft travels in a straight line across the map then it
                can be described with just two positions - its start position and its end position - rather than hundreds of positions that together
                end up describing a straight line.
            </p>
            <p>
                With that in mind, if just positions are being sent (<em>TT</em> is empty or missing) then the first value is latitude, the second value
                is longitude and the third is the heading angle (see <em>Trak</em>) that the aircraft was pointing in when it was at that position.
            </p>
            <p>
                If altitude or speeds are also being sent (<em>TT</em> is either 'a' for altitude or 's' for speed) then the first value is latitude, the second
                longitude, the third is heading and the fourth is either altitude or speed.
